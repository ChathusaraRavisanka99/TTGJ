/**
 * The Navbar is fixed (not sticky) so it can float transparently over the
 * homepage's full-bleed hero. Every other storefront page needs top padding
 * to clear it, since fixed elements are pulled out of document flow. Admin
 * routes render their own chrome (see SiteChrome) and never show the public
 * Navbar at all, so they need neither the home treatment nor the padding.
 *
 * `key={pathname}` forces a fresh <main> on every navigation so
 * .animate-page-in's entrance (see globals.css) restarts each time instead
 * of only playing once on first load — without it, React would just patch
 * the existing DOM in place and the new page would simply pop in, which is
 * the "not just appearing right away" this exists to fix. Each route is
 * already an independent Server Component render, so remounting here
 * doesn't lose anything a real navigation wouldn't already have reset.
 *
 * The "blur the outgoing page" part of a navigation's loading feedback
 * lives in NavigationOverlay (see SiteChrome), not here — an earlier
 * version tried to do it here by holding the previous `children` in state
 * for a beat before swapping. Verified live (instrumented render/effect
 * logging) that doesn't work reliably: Next's Suspense-streamed
 * `children` and `usePathname()` don't always update in lockstep, so
 * "snapshot the old children" ended up snapshotting the *new* route's
 * loading.tsx fallback in some runs instead of the actual outgoing page.
 * A `backdrop-blur` overlay sitting on top of whatever's currently
 * painted sidesteps that entirely — it doesn't care what's underneath or
 * when it changes.
