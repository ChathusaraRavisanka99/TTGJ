/**
 * Next.js mounts this automatically (as a Suspense fallback) any time a
 * route segment's data fetch takes long enough to be perceptible — no
 * manual wiring needed beyond the sibling loading.tsx files that render it.
 * Shares IntroLoader's visual language (serif wordmark, gold kicker, a thin
 * gold rule) since that's the animation moment already established as the
 * site's signature, but calibrated differently: IntroLoader is a one-shot,
 * multi-second reveal gated to play once per session; this can mount and
 * unmount at any moment depending on how long the real fetch takes.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain Server Component with a CSS keyframe animation, not
 * a motion/react client component: a loading indicator needs to paint the
 * instant it mounts, including in the exact "JS is still loading" moments
 * it exists to cover for — a JS-library-driven animation can itself be
 * delayed by that same slow load, which showed up as a real, confirmed
 * blank-charcoal flash under a throttled-network test.
 *
 * A flat, edge-to-edge charcoal fill read as the page abruptly going
 * blank rather than a deliberate moment, especially for a navigation that
 * only briefly interrupts a mid-scroll page — the radial glow behind the
 * mark and the gem cluster above it are both here to make this read as a
 * designed beat (the site's own "catching the light" motif) instead of a
 * blackout.
 *
 * The wordmark/kicker/rule glow-and-dim on an unending loop (rather than
 * just sitting there once loader-in's one-shot entrance finishes) so a
 * navigation that takes a couple of seconds still visibly reads as "still
 * working," not "stuck." Page content picks up the baton on the other end
 * — see .animate-page-in in MainWrapper — so the loader's exit and the new
 * page's arrival read as one continuous motion.
