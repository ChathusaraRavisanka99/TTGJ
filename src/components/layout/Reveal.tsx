// IntersectionObserver animation, and anything that can gate a section's
// content on a JS event firing at the right time can fail to fire in time
// (slow hydration, a fast/flicked scroll, a resize, one frame of layout
// thrash while images load in above it). When that happens with a full
// opacity:0 start, the result is a section that's fully blank until
// something nudges the observer — which reads as broken/overlapping
// layout, not a missed animation. At 0.6 the same worst case just looks
// like content still gently settling in, never like something is missing.

/** Fades + slides content up as it scrolls into view. Plays once.
 *
 * `margin: "0px 0px 200px 0px"` is a *positive* bottom margin — it expands
 * the effective viewport 200px past the real bottom edge for the purposes
 * of triggering, so the reveal starts while a section is still below the
 * fold and has finished (800ms) well before the user actually scrolls it
 * into view. The previous `-80px` did the opposite: a negative margin
 * *shrinks* the effective viewport, so a section had to already be
 * visually on screen before the animation even started, leaving it
 * dimmed for a beat on every normal-speed scroll — on a page with several
 * of these sections back to back (see the home page), that reads as
 * janky performance and, mid-transition, can look like broken/overlapping
 * layout rather than a deliberate animation. */
